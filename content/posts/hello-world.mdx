# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

Welcome to our first blog post! In this article, we'll explore how to build a modern blog using Next.js and MDX.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a powerful combination of Markdown and JSX that lets you write content with embedded React components.

### Key Features

- **Component Support**: Use React components directly in your markdown
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful code blocks with proper highlighting
- **Rich Content**: Support for images, links, and more

```tsx
// Example of a React component
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## Why Use Next.js with MDX?

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications:

1. **Performance** 
   - Automatic code splitting
   - Image optimization
   - Static site generation

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Hot reload
   - TypeScript support
   - Built-in routing

### Working with Images

Here's an example of using optimized images:

  alt="Coding on a laptop"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

## Code Examples

Here's how you can style your components:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
}
```

And here's a React component example:

```tsx
function BlogPost({ title, content }) {
  return (
    <article className="prose">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```
